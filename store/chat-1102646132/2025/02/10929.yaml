  Metro Lenin’s Library (Biblioteka lenina) red line\n\nSmall addition. Due to Moscow\
  \ metro opens at 5:30, but the first metro train goes centre stations a bit later.\n\
  \nI’ve checked our first metro\ntrain \U0001F687 by red line will start at from\n\
  \ 05:54. It is OK.\n\nAnd additional. \nMy first metro train by grey line will be\
  \ approach to your neighbouring station at 05:51. I will have 3 minutes to run from\
  \ one station to your station on red line. And from another side of long platform.\n\
  \nLet’s have a next algorithm.\n\nIf you ll be tomorrow on the platform before first\
  \ metro train and no see me or Kirill - you ll go inside this first metro train.\
  \ \nPerhaps, l ll jump this train too at the end of long train and later join your\
  \ by walking inside train."
