text: <b>Apple Spas (Apple Feast Day)</b> is a warm Russian tradition on August 19.
  It is the moment when the first apples of the season are blessed in church and shared
  with loved ones. People bake pies, make jams, and give apples to friends and neighbors.
  The holiday feels like a joyful “thank you” for the summer harvest — something like
  a mix of a church blessing and a harvest festival.
