text: <b>Apple Spas (Apple Feast Day)</b> is a traditional holiday in Russia, celebrated
  on August 19. It marks the time when apples are blessed in church and the harvest
  season begins. People bring apples to church, share them with family and friends,
  and enjoy apple dishes. It is also connected with the idea of gratitude for natureâ€™s
  gifts, similar to a harvest celebration.
