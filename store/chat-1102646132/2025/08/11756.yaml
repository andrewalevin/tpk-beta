  Last time it started raining, and we couldnâ€™t finish the whole route.

  Now the weather forecast looks warm, and since itâ€™s probably the last chance this
  summer for such a long trip (on August 31), weâ€™d love to go!

  If you have the time and feel like getting up a bit earlier this Sunday to join
  us on this little adventure, come along! ðŸš—ðŸŒž'
