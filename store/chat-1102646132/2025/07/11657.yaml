  10 trip!

  I’m thinking we go to Zvenigorod. Yeah, yeah, I know Eduardo’s been there a bunch
  of times already, but it’ll be Oscar’s first time!

  The day might be hot, so going somewhere close to the river sounds like the best
  plan.

  We could start by exploring the town — visit the old church and the ancient monastery
  — then head along the river. We’ll reach the far end where there’s a bike path running
  right along the river. You still haven’t been out that far yet!'
