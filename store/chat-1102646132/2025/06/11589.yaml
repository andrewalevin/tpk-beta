text: "Given a list of stones positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine\
  \ if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog\
  \ is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit.\n\nIf the frog&#x27;s\
  \ last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units.\
  \ The frog can only jump in the forward direction.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\
  \ stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The frog can jump to\
  \ the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone,\
  \ then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th\
  \ stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]\n\
  Output: false\nExplanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap\
  \ between the 5th and 6th stone is too large."
