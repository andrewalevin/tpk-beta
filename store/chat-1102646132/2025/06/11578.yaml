  — the postcard is absolutely lovely, and it truly made my day!

  I really enjoy calligraphy and beautiful handwriting, and the way my name and the
  message were written was just so charming and thoughtful. I don’t think I’ve ever
  seen handwriting quite like that — it felt warm and full of care, like something
  from family.'
